Traffic sign detection and recognition using Machine Learning. At least that's the goal ;)

# Introduction
My goal is to build my own traffic sign detection and recognition program. I want to come up with a way to analyse a video of driving in real-time and detect as well as classify the road signs as you drive by them. Since I live in Germany, I am going to focus on german traffic signs. Ideally this would be some sort of device you just stick behind your windshield and it displays the detected traffic signs on a little built-in screen.

I post regular updates on my progress on this project over on my [Blog](https://denishartl.com).
